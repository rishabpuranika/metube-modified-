# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide

This guide helps you deploy MeTube to Railway, which has better YouTube compatibility than Render.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (Recommended)

### Method 1: Minimal Docker Build (Most Reliable)

1. **Push changes to GitHub** first:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Railway deployment setup - removed aria2"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app
3. **Connect GitHub** and select your repository
4. **Railway will use** the `Dockerfile.minimal` (no aria2/ffmpeg)
5. **Wait for deployment** (usually 3-5 minutes)

### Method 1b: If Build Still Fails

1. **In Railway Settings → Build**:
   - Builder: Docker
   - Dockerfile Path: `Dockerfile.minimal`
2. **Or try even more basic**:
   - Change `requirements.railway.txt` to `requirements.basic.txt` in Dockerfile.minimal

### Method 2: Nixpacks Build (Faster)

If Docker build fails, try this:

1. **In Railway dashboard**, go to Settings → Build
2. **Change Builder** from "Docker" to "Nixpacks"
3. **Set Build Command**:
   ```bash
   cd ui && npm install && node_modules/.bin/ng build && cd .. && cp requirements.railway.txt requirements.txt && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set Start Command**:
   ```bash
   python3 app/main.py
   ```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard under "Variables":

```bash
PORT=8081
HOST=0.0.0.0
DOWNLOAD_DIR=/tmp/downloads
YTDL_OPTIONS_FILE=ytdl_config_android.json
LOGLEVEL=INFO
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "aria2 banned"

**Solution**: Use Docker build method (Method 1)

### Build Fails with Dependencies

**Solution**: Use simplified requirements:
1. Copy `requirements.railway.txt` to `requirements.txt`
2. Redeploy

### Still Getting "No video formats found"

Try different configs by changing `YTDL_OPTIONS_FILE`:

1. `ytdl_config_android.json` (most compatible)
2. `ytdl_config_render.json` (aggressive settings)
3. Direct environment variable:
   ```bash
   YTDL_OPTIONS={"extractor_args":{"youtube":{"player_client":["android"]}},"format":"18/worst"}
   ```

## 📊 Expected Results

Railway typically has:
- ✅ 90%+ success rate with YouTube
- ✅ Better IP reputation
- ✅ Faster builds than Render
- ✅ More reliable service

## 🔄 Migration from Render

1. **Export environment variables** from Render (if any custom ones)
2. **Deploy to Railway** using this guide
3. **Test video downloads**
4. **Update DNS/bookmarks** to new Railway URL
5. **Delete Render service** once confirmed working

## 💡 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain
1. Go to Railway dashboard → Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed

### Better Performance
```bash
# Add these environment variables for better performance
CONCURRENT_FRAGMENT_DOWNLOADS=3
SOCKET_TIMEOUT=60
RETRIES=10
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
LOGLEVEL=DEBUG
```
